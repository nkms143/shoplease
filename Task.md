Map out a step-by-step guide to connect your GitHub Pages frontend (shoplease) with a free SQL backend so that we can handle real rent collection, GST reports, and secure login.


Considerations & Next Steps
- Authentication: GitHub Pages is static, so login validation here is likely simulated or depends on client-side checks. For real secure login, we need a backend (e.g., Node.js, Firebase, or SQL integration).
- Data Management: Since we are expanding into SQL, we could connect this frontend to a hosted database (like Supabase or Railway) for live rent collection and reporting.
- Deployment Options: If we want dynamic features (like server-side validation or automated reports), moving from GitHub Pages to Render, Vercel, or Netlify would give us backend support.
